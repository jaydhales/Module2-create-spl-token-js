# Candy Machine UI with Custom SPL Token Integration

This project demonstrates a Candy Machine UI that integrates with a custom SPL token for payments during NFT minting on the Solana blockchain.

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary code to set up a Candy Machine UI that requires users to pay in a custom SPL token for minting NFTs.

- (Module3-Candymachine)[https://github.com/jaydhales/Module2-create-spl-token-js/tree/main/Module3-Candymachine] contains code for the Candy Machine Setup using a custom token created in one of the modules.
